### Random thought about our mad world ?

I heard a story about a man who spend 10 years of his life drawing thousand of paintings, only one was sold. He was considered a madman and a loser. After all, he shoot in himself in the chest and died in loneliness and depression. After more than 100 years, people honors him as a famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. I always wonder what happended if he did not commit suicide, no great painter, no multi-million-dollar paintings.

### Our world is so weird and stupid in its way!!!
<br/>
I also read many books, some called classic, some are considered as trash. Just imagine we can ignore all comment about them, how can we separate it whether is such piece of shits or a masterpiece. I am not sure about my analyze ability, I doubt about judgment all time but no way to confirm. Everythings seems like all right or even wrong. I believe some who dead many years ago just because a guy once told me we should believe: When a man dead and people continue talking and reading about him that mean he is authentic person, everything he wrote and said are postulate or at least many others think so.
<br/>
I am not active person. I do things in the influence of other people: Dad and Mom, my teacher, my mentor or even some stupid guys on Internet. They give me choices, I have to choose. Remember there is no correct choice just   fit the most in current situation. Someone said to me that grown-up is when you have your own choice for all answers of life then accept what you did whether it lead to good thing or not. No one have enough wisdom to show you what to do or responsible for what you did. But almost people around you can judge you again again every step you take or every action you move. Sometimes you met some people who want to become a GOD to command, decry, judge others even they have no idea and have a  funny point of view. That make them look like a saint.
<br/>
I always wonder what make  things become great, what decide how important you are and how sucessfull you will gain. You are what others people just consider you are. No matter how hard you try, how pain you suffer to go through the life, people never care about that. One day, with your own luck, not your own efforts, people recognize you, honor you. You think you did get great thing but just illusion. No less, no more.
